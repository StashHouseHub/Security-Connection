Security-Tool
-----------------
__Run as Administrator__
* Used to improve network security and gaming latency

FlushDNS
------------
__Run as Administrator__
* Removes all cached DNS entries on your machine, including both successful and failed lookups, forcing new queries to DNS servers
  
* Ensures you get updated IP information if a site’s address has changed, instead of your device using an old, wrong record

* Clears potentially corrupted or tampered DNS cache data that could be causing errors or redirecting you incorrectly
  
* Improve privacy slightly by wiping local DNS history that reveals what domains you’ve recently visited
